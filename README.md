# Instagram clone
I made this to experiment with tailwind, firebase and nextjs.

It includes:
- Login with google
- Add a post
- Add a comment
- Add a like
- Logout

All posts, comments, likes are realtime too.

Photos are also uploaded to firebase storage.

In the future I would like to add:
- [ ] Show more to comments section so it isn't massive.
- [ ] Lazy load in posts
- [ ] Optimize image size upon upload
- [ ] Profile page
- [ ] Add story
- [ ] View story
- [ ] Remove story
- [ ] Follow users
- [ ] Tailor the feed dependent on your likes, follows etc.
